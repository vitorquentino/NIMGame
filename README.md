# The Nim Game

This script allows you to play the Nim game against the computer.
(More informations about the NIM game:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) 

You can play an only single match or a championship. 

The computer was coded with a mathematical strategy that won even it's possible, but sometimes there is a way that the human player can follow to contour this rule and win the game. Feel free to discovery. 

I wrote this script when I was doing the course: Introduction to Computational Science, by Usp, so, unfortunately the game narration are described in portuguese.
