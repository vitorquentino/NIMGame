# The Nim Game

This script allows you to play the Nim game against the computer. (More information about the NIM game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)

You can play only a single match or a championship.

The computer was coded with a mathematical strategy that won even it's possible, but sometimes there is a way that the human player can follow to contour this rule and win the game. Feel free to discover.

I wrote this code when I was doing the course Introduction to Computational Science, by Usp, so, unfortunately the game narration is described in Portuguese.
